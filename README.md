## NTU CSIE Fundamental Object-Oriented Programming

OOP in Java with some development concepts inspired by @Waterball (i.e. our TA) 
1. Open Closed Principle
   * Structural Variance
   * Behavioral Variance
   * Strategy Pattern + Main Injection
2. Single Responsibility Principle
3. Inheritance and Abstraction

We also learned how to draw UML by AstahUML and derive our mind out of it.
